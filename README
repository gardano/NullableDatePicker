The NullableDatePicker fulfills a UI need that I often have: how to make the NSDatePicker display something when the date value is null.

This first version of NullableDatePicker is my solution.

In a nutshell, if the dateValue is null, or [NSDate nullDate], display an NSButton entitled "Choose". Clicking this Choose Button sets the dateValue to today's date, and also shows a "Clear" button, to allow the user to reset the dateValue to [NSDate nullDate];

In projects using this solution, set the value of any NSDate property to be [NSDate distantFuture], or use the category provided in NSDate+Extras: [NSDate nullDate]. In CoreData, you might want to override awakeFromInsert thusly:

- (void)awakeFromInsert {
	self.date = [NSDate nullDate];
}

The project has these files:

RELEVANT FILES

	* This defines the protocol that the class that's hosting this control uses to set the date value when that value is changed.
NullableDatePicker.[h/m]
	* The control which, based on the value of the property "dateValue", swaps out the NSDatePicker/Clear Buttons.
NullableDatePicker.xib
	* Xib file for the NullableDatePicker.
